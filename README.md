QCM - Quiz Application
QCM is a dynamic quiz application developed by Harimech Siham and Sara Bahassou. It leverages the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js) to provide an interactive platform for users to take quizzes. The project is structured with a client directory for the frontend and a server directory for the backend.
